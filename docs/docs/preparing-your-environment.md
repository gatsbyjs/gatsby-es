To get started with Gatsby, you'll need to make sure you have the following software tools installed:

1.  [Node.js](/tutorial/part-zero/#install-nodejs-for-your-appropriate-operating-system)
2.  [npm CLI](/tutorial/part-zero/#check-your-nodejs-installation)
3.  [Gatsby CLI](/tutorial/part-zero/#using-the-gatsby-cli)

For step-by-step installation instructions and detailed explanations of the required software, head on over to the [Gatsby tutorial](/tutorial/part-zero/).

The [Quick Start](/docs/quick-start/) is also available for intermediate to advanced developers.

> **Note:** If you work for an Enterprise-level company where you are unable to pull from public GitHub repositories, you can [still set up Gatsby](/docs/setting-up-gatsby-without-gatsby-new/).
