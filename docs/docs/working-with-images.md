title: Working with Images in Gatsby
---

Optimizing images is a challenge on any website. To utilize best practices for performance across devices, you need multiple sizes and resolutions of each image. Luckily, Gatsby has several useful [plugins](/docs/plugins/) that work together to do that for images on [page components](/docs/building-with-components/#page-components).

The recommended approach is to use [GraphQL queries](/docs/querying-with-graphql/) to get images of the optimal size or resolution, then, display them with the [`gatsby-image`](/packages/gatsby-image/) component.

## Query images with GraphQL

Querying images with GraphQL allows you to access the image's data as well as perform transformations with [Sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp), a high-performance image processing library.

You'll need a few plugins for this:

- [`gatsby-source-filesystem`](/packages/gatsby-source-filesystem/) plugin allows you to [query files with GraphQL](/docs/querying-with-graphql/#images)
- [`gatsby-plugin-sharp`](/packages/gatsby-plugin-sharp) powers the connections between Sharp and Gatsby Plugins
- [`gatsby-transformer-sharp`](/packages/gatsby-transformer-sharp/) allows you to create multiples images of the right sizes and resolutions with a query

If the final image is of a fixed size, optimization relies on having multiple resolutions of the image. If it is responsive, that is it stretches to fill a container or page, optimization relies on having different sizes of the same image. See the [Gatsby Image documentation for more information](/packages/gatsby-image/#two-types-of-responsive-images).

You can also use arguments in your query to specify exact, minimum, and maximum dimensions. See the [Gatsby Image documentation for complete options](/packages/gatsby-image/#two-types-of-responsive-images).

This example is for an image gallery where images stretch when the page is resized. It uses the `fluid` method and the fluid fragment to grab the right data to use in `gatsby-image` component and arguments to set the maximum width as 400px and maximum height as 250px.

```js
export const query = graphql`
  query {
    fileName: file(relativePath: { eq: "images/myimage.jpg" }) {
      childImageSharp {
        fluid(maxWidth: 400, maxHeight: 250) {
          ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid
        }
      }
    }
  }
`
```

## Optimizing images with gatsby-image

[`gatsby-image`](/packages/gatsby-image/) is a plugin that automatically creates React components for optimized images that:

> - Loads the optimal size of image for each device size and screen resolution
> - Holds the image position while loading so your page doesn't jump around as images load
> - Uses the "blur-up" effect i.e. it loads a tiny version of the image to show while the full image is loading
> - Alternatively provides a "traced placeholder" SVG of the image
> - Lazy loads images, which reduces bandwidth and speeds the initial load time
> - Uses [WebP](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/) images, if browser supports the format

Here is an image component that uses the query from the previous example:

```jsx
<Img fluid={data.fileName.childImageSharp.fluid} alt="" />
```

## Using fragments to standardize formatting

What if you have a bunch of images and you want them all to use the same formatting?

A custom fragment is an easy way to standardize formatting and re-use it on multiple images:

```js
export const squareImage = graphql`
  fragment squareImage on File {
    childImageSharp {
      fluid(maxWidth: 200, maxHeight: 200) {
        ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid
      }
    }
  }
`
```

The fragment can then be referenced in the image query:

```js
export const query = graphql`
  query {
    image1: file(relativePath: { eq: "images/image1.jpg" }) {
      ...squareImage
    }

    image2: file(relativePath: { eq: "images/image2.jpg" }) {
      ...squareImage
    }

    image3: file(relativePath: { eq: "images/image3.jpg" }) {
      ...squareImage
    }
  }
`
```
