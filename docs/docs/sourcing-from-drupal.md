## Why use Drupal + Gatsby together?

Using Drupal as a headless CMS with Gatsby is a great way to get an enterprise-quality CMS for free, paired with a great modern development experience and all the benefits of the JAMstack, like performance, scalability, and security.

It only takes a few steps to use Gatsby with Drupal as a headless CMS (also known as decoupled Drupal).

## How to implement Drupal + Gatsby

### Quick start

This guide assumes that you have a Gatsby project set up. If you need to set up a project, head to the [Quick Start guide](/docs/quick-start/), then come back.

### gatsby-config.js

Hooking up Gatsby to a new or existing Drupal site takes only a few steps.

- Follow the `gatsby-source-drupal` [installation instructions](/packages/gatsby-source-drupal/?=drupal) to add the plugin to your Gatsby site

An example of how to include the `gatsby-source-drupal` plugin in your `gatsby-config.js` file:

```javascript:title=gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
    title: `Gatsby with Drupal`,
  },
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-drupal`,
      options: {
        baseUrl: `https://live-contentacms.pantheonsite.io/`,
        apiBase: `api`,
      },
    },
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-google-analytics`,
      options: {
        trackingId: `UA-93349937-2`,
      },
    },
    `gatsby-plugin-offline`,
    `gatsby-plugin-glamor`,
    `gatsby-plugin-sharp`,
    `gatsby-transformer-sharp`,
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-typography`,
      options: {
        pathToConfigModule: `src/utils/typography.js`,
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

## Why use Gatsby and Drupal together?

[“Decoupled Drupal”](https://www.acquia.com/drupal/decoupled-drupal) has become an increasingly popular approach to building enterprise-grade websites, and has the [full-throated support](https://dri.es/how-to-decouple-drupal-in-2018) of Drupal community leaders. Using Gatsby in a decoupled Drupal setup allows your team to access the powerful content modeling and access workflow capabilities of Drupal 8, as well as the powerful UI creation & performance toolset of Gatsby.

## Configuring Gatsby Live Preview

The [Gatsby Drupal Module](https://www.drupal.org/project/gatsby) enhances the content editor experience when using Gatsby with Drupal as a data source. This module provides Gatsby live preview capabilities using your [Gatsby Cloud account](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/get-started) or on your [locally running Gatsby development server](/docs/running-a-gatsby-preview-server/).

While not required in order to build a Gatsby site that uses Drupal data, this module is the place where additional features are added to improve the Gatsby and Drupal integration.
