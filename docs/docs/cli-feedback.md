title: Gatsby CLI Feedback
---

Gatsby users will be prompted every 3 months (at the most) to give feedback on Gatsby's products and services. This feedback is incredibly valuable and will help the team shape Gatsby.

## How to opt-out

Users may always opt-out from the feedback prompts with `gatsby feedback --disable` or by setting the [environment variable](/docs/environment-variables/) `GATSBY_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` to `1`.
