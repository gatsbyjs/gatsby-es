## Welcome!

During Hacktoberfest, you're probably looking to contribute to an open source project. Gatsby is a great project to contribute to because you can learn about Gatsby while tackling issues that help the community. We'll keep adding new issues throughout the month, so continue checking [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues) for additional ways to contribute!

### Back up. What's Hacktoberfest?

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is "a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean and DEV".

## Issue areas

We are organizing issues into four different areas:

### [Docs][docs-filter]

We love our docs! Improving docs is a never-ending effort, and we have some [stub articles](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/stub-list/) (docs we want to exist, but haven't been written yet). If you're interested in contributing to the docs and doing some writing, check out [docs issues labelled with Hacktoberfest][docs-filter].

[docs-filter]: https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Hacktoberfest%22+label%3A%22type%3A+documentation%22

### Docs localization

Want to do help us translate the Gatsby docs? Consider contributing to an existing repo (we have Spanish and Russian so far!), or start a new language translation by [opening an issue](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/how-to-file-an-issue/) to create a new repo and earn Hacktoberfest credit by contributing PRs to that repo.

- Spanish repo: https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-es
- Russian repo: https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-ru
- New translation repo request: https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/new?template=new_translation.md

### [OSS][oss]

Make OSS contributions to Gatsby plugins, transformers and core by searching [OSS Hacktoberfest issues][oss].

### Ecosystem

Learn how to contribute to the Gatsby Ecosystem (starter library, site showcase, themes and plugin library, etc.) by reading the doc on [Community Contributions](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/community-contributions/). You can gain credit for both Hacktoberfest and Gatsby swag by submitting a PR with your Gatsby project to the starter library or site showcase in this repo. You can also check out issues labeled with [ecosystem](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AHacktoberfest+label%3A%F0%9F%8E%AFEcosystem+) to get Hacktoberfest credit!

Gatsby [plugins](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/creating-plugins/) and [themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/building-themes/) (a type of plugin) [published with the necessary files](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/submit-to-plugin-library/) can also count toward Hacktoberfest credit and earn Gatsby swag. This post will list all plugins created during Hacktoberfest: create your own and add it here in a Pull Request to get credit!

#### Plugins Created During Hacktoberfest

## Gatsby's Hacktoberfest Goals

1. To provide a range of issues with a clearly defined scope, with minimal context needed outside of the issue description.
2. To make contributing to Gatsby as welcoming, friendly, and accessible as we can -- especially to first-time contributors.
