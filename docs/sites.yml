    Hey. I’m Kris. I’m an interactive designer / developer. I grew up in Umeå,
    in northern Sweden, but I now live in Brooklyn, NY. I am currently enjoying
    a hybrid Art Director + Lead Product Engineer role at a small startup called
    Nomad Health. Before that, I was a Product (Engineering) Manager at Tumblr.
    Before that, I worked at agencies. Before that, I was a baby. I like to
    design things, and then I like to build those things. I occasionally take on
    freelance projects. Feel free to get in touch if you have an interesting
    project that you want to collaborate on. Or if you just want to say hello,
    that’s cool too.
